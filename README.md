A discord bot that allows you to keep sticky messages at the bottom of a channel.
Instructions:
1.    Open sticky.py or stickybot.exe if you downloaded the exe
2.    The bot will close itself and create a JSON file, open the JSON file with a text editor
3.    Enter your bot token and then enter the channel IDs of the channels you want the bot to run in under "bot_message" and "allowed       channels" (replace the channel_id_1in both instances but keep the "").
4.    Replace the "message 1\nThis will be in a new line" per channel (this can be different per channel),n "\n" will create a new line, if you don't put it in, everything will be in a single line.
5.    Reastart the bot and you will see "Bot is ready" on the console.
